Al these scripts have been used for my Master's Thesis. There are different tools I have used to, 
for example, make .xyz files for molecule visualization - I recommend Jmol - or to define the Tight-Binding and 
Hubbard Hamiltonians for a Self-Consisten Field method. They are specific for Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons but with small
tweaks can be used for other systems. All graphs in my work have been obtained with these scripts.

You may copy this code for your own personal use and modify it as you see fit.
