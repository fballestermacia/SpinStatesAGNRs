Al these scripts have been used for my Master's Thesis. There are different tools I have used so as to, 
for example, make .xyz files for molecule visualization - I recommend Jmol - or to define the Tight-Binding and 
Hubbard Hamiltonians for a Self-Consisten Field method. They are specific for Armchair Graphene Nanoribbons but with small
tweaks can be used for other systems. All graphs in my work have been obtained with these scripts.

The code is rough and not well documentes. I will work on cleaning it up as soon as possible.

You may copy this code for your own personal use and modify it as you see fit.

If you have any comments, suggestions or issues that might arise, please contact me at fballestermacia@gmail.com
